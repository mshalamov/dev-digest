## What Works

## What Doesn't Work

## Codebase Patterns
- 2026-10-05 `RunSummary` (`cost_usd`) and `PrMeta` cost fields were edited in both vendored `shared` copies (client and server); keep them identical or wire parsing drifts. Applies to `src/vendor/shared/contracts/trace.ts:107`.
- 2026-10-05 Supersedes the entry above: `RunStats.cost_usd`, `RunSummary.cost_usd` and `PrMeta.cost_usd` live in both vendored copies, but the `trace.ts` copies already differ in the `PromptAssembly` doc comments (lines 44-46), so edit each by hand and never copy one over the other. Applies to `src/vendor/shared/contracts/trace.ts:44`.
